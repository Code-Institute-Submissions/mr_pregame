## **Introduction**

Mr. Pregame Sports Betting Management plans to be a one stop shop for all sports betting research and bet tracking. As the Sport Wagering industry legalizes and grows in the states, I find that in order to make educated decisions on which teams to bet on you have to bounce around to three or four different sites to get everything you need and then another app to track all the bets that you've made. My plan with Mr. Pregame was to simplify that whole process and offer all the services for free in one place. For users that want an expert opinion or skip the whole pregame research all together, using a subscription model Mr. Pregame offers expert analysis and guaranteed picks.

## **User Experience (UX)**

**Strategy**

As the developer and also an avid sports bettor, I initially started the design process from the mindset of the user. As I would be developing a platform that I, myself was in need of. During this design process I quickly had to switch hats and start thinking from a developers view to take into consideration scalability, functionality and regular maintenence.

**General**

1. As the developer, I wanted to create a full-stack e-commerce site where users can add, edit and delete data.

2. As the developer, I want the website to function well and be fully responsive to demonstrate my coding abilities.

3. As the site owner, I would like as much data as possible autogenerated through API's.

**Aesthetic and UX**

4. As the developer, I want the site to be aestetically pleasing and easy to use to create a positive UX experience for users.

5. As the site owner, I want to create a brand that would welcoming and easy to market.

6. As the site owner, I want to create a rapport with the users and develop trust to eventually upgrade members to a paid membership that offers professional game analysis.

7. As the site owner, I want to create a complete hassle free environment for users through a ease of navigation and accessibility to cancel memberships.

8. As the site owner, I would like to automate as many functions as possible.

**Registration and Subscribing**

9. As a site user, I would like to easily register for an account.

10. As a site user, I would like my account to be secure.

11. As a site user, I would like access to my information to update and delete whenever I want.

12. As a site user, I would like to be able to cancel my subscription without a hassle.

**Navigation**

13. As the site owner, I would like users to be able to navigate in and out of every page without hitting the back arrow.

14. As the site owner, I would like users to always have access to the 'Subscribe' button if they aren't currently subscribed.

15. As the site owner, I would like all the daily games organized by sport/leagues.

**Checkout**

16. As a site user, I want to be able to easily and quickly enter my payment details, so I can checkout quickly, hassle free.

17. As a site user, I want my monthly subscription fee directly charged to my credit card without having to re-enter information.

**Admin**

18. As the site owner, I would like to quickly update game lines and stats.

19. As the site owner, I would like to easily write and show game breakdowns and picks for subscribers.

**Structure**

Base all the required features and data that needed to be shown for users, I decided I wanted to include the following pages on my website:

* The Home page welcomes the user to the site and presents the user with calls to action to subscribe for a paid membership.

* The log in and sign up pages allow users to log in and create their memebership.

* The Suscribe page allows users to enter all their billing info and start their monthly subscription.

* The Profile page (paid subscribers only) displays all the game picks for that given day. Profile page also has a link to edit profile information, email, passwords and cancel subscriptions. Coming soon, paid users will also have bet tracking available which will be displayed in the profile.

* The Games page lists all the games for that day based on what league they picked, MLB, NCAA Basketball, NBA or NFL. The data pulled via API displays teams, times, locations, game lines as well as a button to go to the Matchup Page.

* The Matchup Page has all the data and stats for the teams involved in the game chosen. As well as game picks and a carousel that cycles through all the other games of that day.
